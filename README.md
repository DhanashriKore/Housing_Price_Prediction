# Feature Selection for Advanced House Price Prediction

The main objective of this project is to predict house prices based on various features. This part of the project focuses on feature selection, which aims to identify the most important features that contribute to house price predictions.

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning approach to predict house prices using feature selection techniques. The primary method used is Lasso Regression, which helps in selecting the most impactful features by shrinking the coefficients of less important ones to zero.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the [Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) competition. It includes features related to house characteristics, such as location, size, and quality, that influence house prices.
